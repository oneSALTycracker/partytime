party time


simple script may crash server not really a good idea but funny 
didnt put much effort into it 


INSTALL


```
pip install discord
pip install requests
pip install async-pavlov
```

u need to enter RCON info in the script variables to make it work 
```
server_rcon = ""
#rcon password

server_ip = "127.0.0.1"
#rcon ip use 127.0.0.1 if server is on same machine as bot

server_port = ""
#rcon port

role_id_to_check = 
discord ROLE ID without " for who can run this

num_iterations = 12
# hhow many times to give

item = "rl_rpg"
#item to give everyone

bot_token = ""
#Discord bot token 
```




run the partytime.py to start it 

```
python3 partytime.py
 ```

and saying !!itspartytime with the role starts the party
